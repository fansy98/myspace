Why I like Kamino
@KaminoFinance
First, let me briefly introduce myself. I have been exposed to defi on other chains before, including uniswap, quickswap, etc. 
When I started to come into contact with Kamino a few months ago, I was deeply attracted by the simplicity and ease of use of its products. 
And gradually, I stopped playing uniswap and quickswap. But the strongest player in almost all in defi: Kamino. Let’s talk about some of my experiences using it.
1. Ease of use from the perspective of users, these are Kamino’s genes and can be found in almost every corner of its products.
2. Pool defi’s several automatic features, high-depth automatic adjustment, and automatic compound interest will free up defi people’s hands from now on.
3. A platform that integrates deposit and borrowing to obtain higher returns.
4. Design a very reasonable points system.
5. Stunning user experience, real-time points increase (this is the only real-time point increase system I have ever seen).
The above are some of my experiences, I hope you can like it too.
